        <h3>Gustavo</h3>
        <p>Hi, everyone! My name is Gustavo Luz, I live in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, yeah, yeah, the one with the big Christ.
            I married in the temple for eternity with my wife Ana, we just started our life together and are planning to have
            a bright future.    
        </p>
        <p>I was not always a church member, my cousin told me about the church when I was 12 years old, teaching me gospel
            principles. I got baptized when I was 15 years and decided to go on I mission. I served in Salvador, a state of 
            Brazil, and by coincidence, it was the place where I was born.
        <p> I am currently trying to learn as much about programming as I can, and I hope I will earn a degree in Database. I want to become the best programmer I can be.
            I am very excited to learn new things, started my career, and keep pursuing my goals!
        <p>That's it, that's me!</p>
